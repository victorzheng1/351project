Provided is a step by step guide to install OpenSlide for python on Windows

Step 1

Go to Openslide project Download
https://openslide.org/download/

Step 2
Download the most recent 64-bit binary.
Note where you're saving the binaries. 
I saved it 'C:\\Windows\\System32\\openslide-win64-20171122\\bin' but you may chose to place it else where.

Step 3
In the command line type
pip instal openslide-python

Step 4
Go to the script called
lowlevel.py

It will probably be somewhere like
C:\Users\~\Python\Python38\Lib\site-packages\openslide

Step 5
In the script at line 42, after the import statements add

import os
os.add_dll_directory('C:\\Windows\\System32\\openslide-win64-20171122\\bin')

This will allow python to find the dll.
